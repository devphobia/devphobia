## Who exactly am I?
<p align="justify">
    My name is Gabriel and I'm currently a Computer Science undergraduate at <b>UFSC - Universidade de Santa Catarina</b>. 
    I'm a Python enthusiast and aspiring Data Scientist. I've got a array range of interests in programming that range 
    from machine learning and AI related topics to game development and desktop applications.

I'm currently finishing reading _Automating the Boring Stuff_ by _Al Sweigwart_ and _Data Science from Scratch_ by _Joel Grus_.

My non-programming hobbies include reading philosophy, gaming and watching underground movies.
